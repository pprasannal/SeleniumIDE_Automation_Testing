# SeleniumIDE (Automation_Testing)

TOOL:
Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the simplest tool in the Selenium Suite. It is support multibrowsers like Chrome, firefox by add-on and that creates tests very quickly through its record-and-playback functionality. This feature is similar to that of QTP. It is effortless to install and easy to learn.
It should only be used as a prototyping tool, not an overall solution for developing and maintaining complex test suites.
we should at least be familiar with HTML, JavaScript, and the DOM (Document Object Model) to utilize this tool to its full potential. Selenium IDE supports autocomplete mode when creating tests. This feature serves 2 purposes:
> It helps the tester to enter commands more quickly.
> It restricts the user from entering invalid commands.
